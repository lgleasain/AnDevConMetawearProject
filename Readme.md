AnDevCon Example MetaWear Application
=====================================

This is a example application that demonstrates how to connect,  read information and interact with the accelerometer on a MetaWear R from Mbientlab.  You can find out more about Metawear at www.mbientlab.com

These examples were live coded during the AnDevCon class and may not have the cleanest code organization or follow every Android best practice.  Pull requests are welcome.
